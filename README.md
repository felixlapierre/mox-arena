# mox-arena

An arena fighting game made by Felix Lapierre using the C# programming language and Monogame.
2017

The Monogame framework must be installed to run the project. The game can also be ran as an executable if you have DirectX installed. The executable MainGame.exe can be found in RPG Game\MainGame\MainGame\bin\Windows\Debug.

There are still many incomplete features in this game, namely the level editor and adventure mode. I'd like to revisit it in the future, but for now the project is on hold.
