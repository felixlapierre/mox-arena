# mox-arena

An arena fighting game made by Felix Lapierre using the C# programming language and Monogame.
2017

The Monogame framework must be installed to run the project. The game can also be ran as an executable if you have DirectX installed. The executable MainGame.exe can be found in RPG Game\MainGame\MainGame\bin\Windows\Debug.

There are still many incomplete features in this game, namely the level editor and adventure mode. The code startet off very messy and was only split in a handful of 3000-line source code files. I learnt C# while making this game, so its design follows no good programming principles. I am in the process of refactoring the code to use healthier design principles.
